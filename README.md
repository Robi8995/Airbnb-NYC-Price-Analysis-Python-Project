## üéØ Project Objective

**Objective:** Analyze Airbnb pricing dynamics across New York City neighborhoods to identify price drivers, understand market segmentation by room type, discover geographical pricing patterns, and evaluate seasonal trends‚Äîenabling data-driven pricing strategies, competitive positioning, and revenue optimization for hosts and property managers.

**Dataset:** `AB_NYC_2019.csv` | **Industry:** Travel & Hospitality Analytics

**Problem Statement:**

Airbnb hosts and property managers face challenges in setting competitive prices without clear market insights. Questions remain unanswered: How do neighborhood and room type influence prices? Which areas command premium rates? Are there seasonal pricing opportunities? Without data-driven pricing analysis, hosts risk underpricing (leaving revenue on table) or overpricing (losing bookings). This project provides comprehensive price analysis, neighborhood profiling, room-type segmentation, and seasonality insights to optimize pricing strategies, maximize occupancy rates, and increase revenue per listing.

- Verify dataset structure and row/column count

### Block 2: Data Exploration & Inspection
- Display first/last rows and dataset shape
- Check data types and memory usage
- Identify missing values and their distribution
- Generate initial descriptive statistics (`.describe()` and `.info()`)
- Examine unique values in categorical columns

### Block 3: Neighborhood Group Price Analysis
- Group by `neighbourhood_group` (boroughs) and calculate average prices
- Rank boroughs by average nightly rate
- Create bar chart comparing price across Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, Bronx, Staten Island
- Identify premium vs. budget neighborhoods by borough

### Block 4: Room Type Price Analysis
- Segment market by `room_type`: Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room
- Calculate average price per room type
- Visualize room-type pricing distribution with bar charts
- Analyze pricing hierarchy and revenue potential per room type

### Block 5: Top 20 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods
- Group by `neighbourhood_group` and `neighbourhood` to calculate neighborhood-level averages
- Sort by price descending and extract top 20 neighborhoods
- Create horizontal bar chart with color-coding by borough
- Identify luxury market hotspots and premium pricing zones

### Block 6: Seasonality & Temporal Analysis
- Convert `last_review` to datetime format
- Extract month from review dates to proxy booking patterns
- Calculate average price by month (1-12)
- Create line plot showing seasonal price trends across year
- Identify peak seasons (June-August) and off-peak periods

### Block 7: Data Cleaning & Outlier Removal
- Remove listings with `price = 0` (inactive/invalid listings)
- Remove top 1% extreme price outliers (above 99th percentile) for realistic analysis
- Cap `minimum_nights` at 30 for normalization (remove extreme values)
- Validate cleaned dataset size and price distribution

### Block 8: Price Distribution by Room Type (Advanced Visualization)
- Create dual visualization: Boxplot + Histogram
- Boxplot shows price spread, quartiles, and outliers per room type
- Histogram shows frequency distribution with stacked counts by room type

| **Price Std. Deviation** | High variability |
| **Geographic Coverage** | 5 NYC boroughs, 226 neighborhoods |

**Insight:** The NYC Airbnb market shows high price variability with median significantly below mean, indicating right-skewed distribution with luxury outliers inflating average prices.

### Pricing by Borough (Neighbourhood Group)

**Key Finding:** Manhattan and Brooklyn dominate as premium markets with highest average nightly rates, while Bronx and Staten Island represent emerging, budget-friendly alternatives.

- **Manhattan:** Highest average prices, premium locations, luxury neighborhoods (Tribeca, SoHo, Chelsea, Midtown)
- **Brooklyn:** Strong secondary market, diverse neighborhoods, competitive pricing
- **Queens:** Budget-friendly options, family-oriented, value segment
- **Bronx:** Emerging market, affordable rates, underserved segment
- **Staten Island:** Entry-level pricing, developing tourism

**Insight:** Borough selection directly impacts pricing power‚ÄîManhattan listings command 2-3x premium over outer boroughs.

### Pricing by Room Type

| Room Type | Market Position | Pricing Strategy | Target Audience |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Entire home/apt** | Premium | Highest prices | Families, groups, long-term |
| **Private room** | Mid-range | Moderate prices | Solo travelers, business |
| **Shared room** | Budget | Lowest prices | Backpackers, budget travelers |

**Insight:** Entire apartments are 2-3√ó more expensive than private rooms. Room type is primary pricing lever after location.

### Top 20 Most Expensive Neighbourhoods

**Finding:** Luxury neighborhoods concentrated in Manhattan including Tribeca, SoHo, Chelsea, Midtown, and East Village‚Äîcommanding $400-$540+ nightly rates.

**Insight:** Top 20 neighborhoods average $380+ vs. citywide average of $152 (2.5x premium). Geographic concentration indicates market segmentation between luxury and mainstream segments.

### Seasonality & Temporal Patterns

**Finding:** Prices show minor seasonal fluctuation with slight peaks during summer months (June-August) and relatively stable pricing throughout year.

**Insight:** NYC's year-round tourism drives consistent demand. Summer peak (8-10% premium) suggests dynamic pricing opportunity during peak tourist seasons. Holiday periods (Nov-Dec, Jan) show maintained pricing due to holiday travel demand.
